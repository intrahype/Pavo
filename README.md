Archival tool for Metadata editing

Personal Project to create a python script to change metadata on photos, and a GUI that allows easier input methods for new data.

V0.1 Began June, 2024 - Going to split project as two python scripts, with an HTML form in the middle. Grab Metadata - Create Form - Accept new input - apply changes
